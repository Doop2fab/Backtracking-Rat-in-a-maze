# Backtracking-Rat-in-a-Maze
Implementation of Backtracking Algorithms
 * This is a program which extends the Swing framework that solves Rat-in-a-Maze problems. 
 * It implements simple Backtracking by recursively determining if a space is safe to move to or not and, if the space in question is "un-safe", the rat backtracks. 
 * I have included 3 preset mazes, along with the ability to draw your own mazes.
